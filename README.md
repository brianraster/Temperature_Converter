# Temperature_Converter
This is a simple temperature converter UI that allows the user to choose which temperature conversion to choose, then after typing the temperature
in to be converted and clicking the convert button; the converted temperature is displayed on the GUI. I am intending on adding functionality for
the Kelvin scale as well.
